# Email Spam Detection Project

## Overview

This project is dedicated to building a machine learning model that can classify emails as either 'ham' (non-spam) or 'spam' with a high accuracy of 97%. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- **Data**: Contains the dataset, including both raw and processed data files.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and analysis.
- **Source Code**: Scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- **Tests**: Unit tests to ensure the functionality of the code.
- **Documentation**: This README file and any additional documentation.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Obtain a copy of the project repository.
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Set up a Python virtual environment for project dependencies.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

To train and evaluate the spam prediction model, you will need to run the main script provided in the repository. This will execute the entire pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and generate the final results.

## Data

The dataset consists of labeled emails, categorized as 'ham' or 'spam'. The data preprocessing step involves cleaning the data, tokenizing text, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

## Model

The machine learning model used in this project includes several stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converting textual data into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF.
3. **Model Training**: Training a classification model using the processed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The model achieves a high accuracy of 97% in classifying emails as either 'ham' or 'spam'. Detailed results, including confusion matrix and performance metrics, are provided to highlight the model's effectiveness.

## Visualization

The project includes visualization tools to help understand the data distribution and model performance. For example, pie charts and bar plots are used to represent the proportion of 'ham' and 'spam' emails and the model's classification results.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and passes all unit tests.
